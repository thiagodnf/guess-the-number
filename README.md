## How to play?

Access https://thiagodnf.github.io/guess-the-number/

## How this works?

The computer will think of a random number from 1 to 1000, and ask you to guess it. The computer will tell you if each guess is too high or too low. You win if you can guess the number.

This is a good game to code because it uses random numbers, loops, and input from the user in a short program. You’ll learn how to convert values to different data types, and why you would need to do this More information at https://inventwithpython.com/chapter4.html

I open-source almost everything I can, and I try to reply to everyone needing help using these projects. Obviously, this takes time. You can integrate and use these projects in your applications for free! You can even change the source code and redistribute (even resell it).

However, if you get some profit from this or just want to encourage me to continue creating stuff, reach out to me if you want to do it.

Thanks!
