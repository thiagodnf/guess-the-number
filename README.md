# How this works?

The computer will think of a random number from 1 to 1000, and ask you to guess it. The computer will tell you if each guess is too high or too low. You win if you can guess the number.

This is a good game to code because it uses random numbers, loops, and input from the user in a short program. Youâ€™ll learn how to convert values to different data types, and why you would need to do this.
